# My Exercisms

I found out about this awesome project [Exercism](http://exercism.io) which pretty much has the concept of crowd-sourcing code reviews. 

It's an awesome idea and I started this repo a bit late with my Ruby code but I hope to do this in all the languages available. 

## Usage

I'm only commiting the source code written by me since the tests and README can be fetched by installing the exercism gem. 

The commited files here will have green tests. This is mostly to track my progress in receiving the critiques.
