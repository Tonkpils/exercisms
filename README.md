# My Exercisms

I found out about this awesome project [Exercism](http://exercism.io) which pretty much has the concept of crowd-sourcing code reviews. 

It's an awesome idea and I started this repo a bit late with my Ruby code but I hope to do this in all the languages available. 

The commited files here will have green tests. This is mostly to track my progress in receiving the critiques.
